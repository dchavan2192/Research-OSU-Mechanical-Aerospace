My role, achievements, publications, and conferences as an Undergraduate Student Researcher for the department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering

# Building autonomous drones for wildfire detection
## Overview
- Compact drones with ML capabilities are an essential way to caputre different data types of wildfires
- A Raspberry Pi 5 is used as an onboard computer to process the computer vision
- Different sensors such as chemical, infrared, and RGB are embedded within the drone build
- Need to calculate flight dynamics, thrust, and flight time based off the payload capacity
- All this is done to further develop Bolz Lab at OSU for current and future research

## Tools/Skills used
- Matlab and Simulink
- Avionic Congfiguration
- Flight Mechanics
