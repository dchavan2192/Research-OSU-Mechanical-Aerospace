# Research @ OSU Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering  
**Wildfire Detection Using Autonomous Drones**

---

## ðŸ“Š Overview

- Designed compact, autonomous drones for **real-time wildfire detection** using onboard computer vision and sensor data.
- Integrated a **Raspberry Pi 5** as the onboard processor to analyze live aerial imagery.
- Embedded **RGB**, **infrared**, and (planned) **chemical sensors** into the drone to detect multiple wildfire indicators.
- Calculated **flight dynamics**, **thrust**, and **battery efficiency** based on payload and environmental constraints.
- This project contributes to ongoing drone development in the **Bolz Lab** at OSU's Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering.
